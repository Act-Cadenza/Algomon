## Algomon Monster Catching Game
### Overview
This is a Blockchain-Based Game or Dapp game developed using Algorand's Pyteal, a smart contract language. The game utilizes Pyteal's global and local states to store necessary values for gameplay. Players can explore a virtual map and engage in the challenge of capturing monsters.

## Game Mechanics

### Connecting with Pera Algo Wallet

To participate in the game, users need to connect with their Pera Algo Wallet. This is done by scanning a QR code generated by the decentralized application (dApp). By connecting their wallet, users can interact with the game and perform various actions.

### Opting in

After connecting with the Pera Algo Wallet, users must opt-in to the smart contract by pressing the "Register" button. This action sets up the initial values for the player's and enemy's stats within the game. Opting in allows the user to participate fully and access all game features.

### In-Game Map:

Once the player's and enemy's stats are set up, the player will spawn on the in-game map. The player can control their in-game character's movements using arrow keys. The objective is to explore the map and encounter monsters. Monsters appear randomly on the map, and the player can choose whether to engage in battle with them or continue exploring.

### In Battle

When a battle with a monster begins, the player has several choices. They can choose to attack the monster, attempt to run away, or try to capture the creature. To capture a monster, the player must first weaken it during the battle. Successfully capturing a monster increases the player's score by 1. If the player defeats a monster, they do not receive any additional score.

### Defeat

If the player is defeated by a monster during a battle, they have the option to resurrect by pressing  the "revive character" button. This action replenishes the player's health and respawns them on the map, allowing them to continue playing the game.
